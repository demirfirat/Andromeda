# Project Name: NFT Ticket Sale

This project is a dedicated NFT ticketing platform for **Andromeda**. Our goal is to provide a transparent, reliable, and transferable ticketing system for event organizers and attendees. Using NFT technology, tickets are created as unique digital assets and hold collectible value even after the event.

## Project Details

NFT ticketing is chosen to address problems in traditional ticketing systems, such as counterfeit tickets, transfer difficulties, and limited usability of tickets. NFT ticketing offers the following benefits:

- **Collectible Value**: After the event, users can keep their tickets as a memento or an investment.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
